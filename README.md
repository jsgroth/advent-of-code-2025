[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2025 solutions

Solution code is in `src/bin/` with one executable per day (`day1`, `day2`, etc). `src/lib.rs` contains shared library code used across multiple solutions.

All solution executables take the input text file path as a single command line argument. Example:

```shell
cargo run --release --bin day1 -- /path/to/input.txt
```
